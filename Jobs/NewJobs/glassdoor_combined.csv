The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health.

Testimonial
I completed a 3-month internship at TEAL, primarily working on research and outreach activities for the company. During my time at TEAL, I was able to hone my writing skills under the guidance of TEAL's co-founder and CEO, Kshitij Batra. I was also given the opportunity to learn to work on different applications and test the company's flagship platform. The team members are friendly and extremely intelligent. In addition to this, everyone is very hardworking and ever-ready to do any sort of grunt work to meet the company goals, regardless of their position in the firm. Working in such a friendly and motivating environment was an amazing experience for me!
Delvin Chacko, Research Intern
My experience at TEAL surpassed all my expectations from the get-go. I was asked to help solve one of the most daunting problems in the Indian real estate market. Every day while working on a subset of the problem, the ideas that I brought to the table were shaped into cohesive solutions by a collaborative team effort. At TEAL I was exposed to the most cutting edge technologies such as Cloud Computing, Big Data, ML and Data Science.

Gyan Vardhan, Data Science Intern
I had interned as a Data Scientist at Terra Economics and Analytics Lab during its early days, it was a rich learning experience working with a multi-disciplinary team who are extremely passionate about building a decision support platform for the insanely complicated realty market in India. It was exciting and challenging to work on mining huge volumes of property records; extracting patterns from the data, building data pipelines and brainstorming on building the core system. TEAL offers a very healthy work environment coupled with insanely talented people working together in an exciting setting.
Naga Anjaneyulu, Data Science Intern

Archana Parmar, Data Science Intern
As a second-year college student, I was looking for an internship that would allow me to delve deeper into research and work with big data, TEAL gave me the perfect opportunity to do so, enabling me to develop proficiency in research and analysis. As a research analyst intern, I collated and cleaned data and helped in the preparation of reports and presentations, and I had members helping me at every stage of this process. This collaborative environment allowed me to cultivate my skills and also learn from my peers. The holy trinity of Rohan, Kshitij, and Shreyas served as not only excellent mentors and bosses but also as friends, helping me at every stage and giving us all food and ice cream to keep us going!
Arush Mehra, Research Intern
Internships are a crucial part of one’s early career. The internship experience at TEAL was a thrilling rollercoaster ride to say the least! It was more than implementing a standard model or building an already though out concept into reality. It was about finding the solution to a unique and open-ended problem.It was exciting to work on addressing a problem with far -reaching real world applications.Moreover, the work environment had the perfect balance of casual yet professional which kept you focused and stress free at the same time. Out of every 100 startups in India only 2 of them succeed, but there are very few like TEAL India which are bound to make it big at such an early stage.
